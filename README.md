# Introduction

I'm learning about ray tracing and graphics programming, as I haven't really worked on projects in that realm since school.
Currently working through the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.

The book can be found and followed here: [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)


## Progress:
Just made it to 4. Rays, a simple camera, and background
